Does you child like to sing or dance? Do you want your child to play an instrument in the near future, but not sure where to start?

My Music Fun Safari class is a perfect way to introduce your child to the wonderful world of music. Groups are limited to 6 children so each child will get a lot of attention. Taught by Liza Debelak, who has over 20 years of music education experience in both Europe and the US.
